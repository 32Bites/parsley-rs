# Parsley: Rust Edition

Parsley is my attempt at writing a library for writing lexers and parsers with ease. This implementation is written in Rust, however, I may create versions for Go, or provide Go bindings for this package.

For now, this README will be rather, devoid of content.

## TODO

1. Write proper unit tests.
2. Clean the source code up.
   1. Make the API less, messy.
   2. Rework spans more cleanly.
3. Write proper documentation.
